# Using the dictionary from the Nested dictionaries exercise above, 
# write a function countFriends() that accepts a dictionary as an argument 
# and returns a new dictionary that includes a new key friends_count:


def countFriends(ramit): 
    for key in ramit: 
        print("key:", key, "value:" [key])



ramit = {'a':1, 'b':2, 'c':3} 
countFriends(ramit)
